## Usage 

This website can be used as a daily planner, you can input your hourly schedule, and get a quick reminder if you haven't completed it that time is running out! It can also be used as a way to study the basics of the concepts we learned this week such as dayjs and jquery, as well as a reminder of the JavaScript we will continue to work with in the future.
